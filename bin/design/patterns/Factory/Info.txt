#Define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but 
 let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

#The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

#Advantage of Factory Design Pattern
	*Factory Method Pattern allows the sub-classes to choose the type of objects to create.
	*loose-coupling (If we want to add new OS we just need to change it in Factory class client just need to call it.


#Usage of Factory Design Pattern
	*When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create
	*When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.
	*When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.
